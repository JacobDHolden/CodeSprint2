#Handicap
#In short, handicapping NFL games is ridcioualsoy time consuming and has already been done by tons of people. 
# Thus, I chose a power rating system that a few pro gamblers have recommended checking out. 
# I will need to mine and clean this to make this a true CS project but I have wasted a lot of time already. 

# I understand that finding the team by the array location is going to seem like an easy way to make errors. 
# Due dillignece and attention to detail is required. 
# The reason why I am doing this is because the power ratings and position of the teams will change weekly. 
# Furthermore, this would require more websites and twitter feeds than I care to imainge at the moment. 

# With all of this typed... I do plan to continue working on this system and eventually developing a a machine that
#1. mines and cleans data from the web
#2. requires minimal user inputs 
#3. actually contains a ML program that predicts winners

#These are all long term goals. 

#Databse for odds of landing on a umber in an NFL Game.
#Chances of hitting point spreads in decimal form

#NFL Spreads in ML Odds

#Below will be an example of how to find the spread of a game. 
# We will say the Kansas City Chiefs will play the San Fransico 49's

#I understand that finding the team by the array location is goingto seem silly. 
#The reason why I am doing this is because the power ratings and position of the teams will change weekly.

#Home Field Advatage, this is the average of the last season.
## Note: Some teams have a higher or lower HFA.

#Next we will have to review injury reports and place a value on the injury reports.
#Placing a value on the injury reports will require scrolling through X.
